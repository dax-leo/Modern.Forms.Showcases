Components used: 
- Modern.Forms core library (with some local modifications)
- Backend: WebAPI, MediatR + Hangfire.
- My own (old) datagrid component (ported from WinForms)
- ReoGrid - ported from WinForms
- GMAP.NET - ported from WinForms
- Calendar Drop Down component - ported from WinForms
- ScottPlot - port to ModernForms

# Conclusion:
Despite few weak points and missing functionallity I like working with Modern.Forms. Modern.Forms is partially based on Avalonia, and we all know Avalonia team did very good job building up base for Avalonia UI. What I don't like is use of WPF/XAML style and overload with so many features, many of which are focused on mobile. In many cases (even for larger business desktop applications) having simple forms with Model-View-Presenter backend is perfectly suitable choice. There are many excellent WinForms controls out there. The goal of my repository (Modern.Forms.Toolkit) is to migrate many of those to Skia suported environment.

Positive:
- Multi OS platform using WinForms style (if you are wpf/xaml hater :).
- Very easy to design and control UI components (even without designer tool).
- Trimming + NativeAoT support (unlike WinForms there are no COM limitations).
- Modern look and feel.
- Solid performance for CPU based rendering (Skia).
- Relatively small application size and low memory usage (only when using single buffer modification).

Negative:
- Requires some effort (and Skia knowledge) to port WinForm controls.
- Control based buffers and re-rendering full frame each time is not the best design choice for larger applications. I had to modify paint methods to use single buffer and render only invalidated controls. This boosted performance significantly.
- Working with separate Form objects is tricky and needs to be improved. Had to apply some tricks to achieve wanted behavior and avoid memory leaks.
- When designing or porting old WinForms controls you must pay special attention to scaling. Many old WinForms control don't have good layout functionallity, so you might loose lot of time finding ways around it.
